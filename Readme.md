## Introduction

In this workshop we will use R to visualise and analyse some of the geological data collected from Biển Hồ lake. The data are available from this publication: 

Nguyễn-Văn, H., Schimmelmann, J. P., Nguyễn-Thùy, D., Ojala, A. E., Unkel, I., Nguyễn-Đình, T., ... & Schimmelmann, A. (2020). Environmental history recorded over the last 70 years in Biển Hồ maar sediment, Central Highlands of Vietnam. _Quaternary International_ Volume 621, Pages 84-100

## Schedule

The workshop has two parts. In the first part we will make three kinds of map and combine them into a multi-panel figure suitable for publication:

1. A country-level map to show the general location of a study area
2. An aerial photo map of a small area to show detail of sampling locations
3. A bathymetry contours and raster map of the study area

In the second part we will make three sets of stratigraphic plots of sediment data:

1. Grain size and magnetic susceptibility 
2. pollen data, including a CONISS stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis
3. geochemical data from XRF measurements, including lithological phases
